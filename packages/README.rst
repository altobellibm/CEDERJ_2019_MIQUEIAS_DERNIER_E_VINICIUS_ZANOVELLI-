Web Scraping Microframework
===========================
This piece of software intended to put together different
widely used frameworks (such as HTTP(S) clients, HTML parsing
and web browser automated drivers), gathering all it takes
for "targeted crawling" (scraping) and abstracting the most
common features into a centralized encapsulation to be
consumed through a simplified API.
